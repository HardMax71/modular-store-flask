                        <h4>1. Eligibility for Returns</h4>
                        <p>To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused, in its original condition, and in the original packaging. {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} reserves the right to refuse returns on certain items due to health, safety, or other regulatory reasons. The eligibility of an item for return will be clearly stated in the product description. In cases of ambiguity, customers are advised to contact {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} for clarification prior to purchase.</p>

                        <h4>2. Return Window</h4>
                        <p>Customers are entitled to initiate a return within {{ config.RETURN_WINDOW }} calendar days from the date of delivery, as recorded in our system. This period shall commence on the day following the delivery date. For items received in a defective state or inconsistent with the order specifications, customers must notify {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} within 48 hours of receipt to ensure prompt resolution.</p>

                        <h4>3. Return Process</h4>
                        <p>To initiate a return, customers must contact {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} via email at <a href="mailto:{{ config.RETURNS_EMAIL }}">{{ config.RETURNS_EMAIL }}</a>. The communication must include the order number and a detailed explanation for the return request. Upon receipt of this information, {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} will provide specific instructions for the return process. Failure to adhere to these instructions may result in delays or rejection of the return.</p>

                        <h4>4. Refunds</h4>
                        <p>Upon receipt and inspection of the returned item, {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} will notify the customer via email regarding the status of their refund. If approved, the refund will be processed to the original method of payment within {{ config.REFUND_PROCESSING_DAYS }} business days. The refund amount will be for the purchase price of the item(s) returned, excluding any shipping charges, unless otherwise required by applicable law. In cases where the return is due to an error on the part of {{ config.SHOP_NAME }}, all associated costs, including shipping, will be refunded.</p>

                        <h4>5. Shipping Costs</h4>
                        <p>The customer shall bear the cost of return shipping, unless the return is necessitated by an error on the part of {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} or as otherwise required by law. Shipping costs are non-refundable and will be deducted from any refund issued, where applicable. {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} recommends that customers use a trackable shipping service and purchase shipping insurance for items of significant value, as {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} cannot be held responsible for items lost or damaged in transit during the return process.</p>

                        <h4>6. Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h4>
                        <p>Certain items, including but not limited to perishable goods, personalized items, and intimate apparel, may be exempt from this return policy. Such exceptions will be clearly indicated in the product description. In cases of force majeure or other extraordinary circumstances, {{ config.SHOP_NAME }} reserves the right to modify this policy temporarily or permanently, with such changes being effective immediately upon posting on the website.</p>

                        <h4>7. Consumer Rights</h4>
                        <p>This Return Policy does not affect any statutory rights that customers may have under applicable consumer protection laws. In the event of any conflict between this policy and applicable law, the provisions of the law shall prevail.</p>
