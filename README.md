This structure represents the main components of the Modular Store Flask project:

- `app.py`: The main entry point of the application.
- `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for different environments.
- `modules/`: Houses the different functional modules of the application.
- `static/`: Contains all static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `templates/`: Holds all the HTML templates used in the application.
- `translations/`: Contains files for internationalization support.
- `instance/`: Stores instance-specific configurations (not version controlled).
- `tests/`: Contains all the unit and integration tests for the project.

Each module in the `modules/` directory typically contains its own views, forms, and utility functions,
promoting a modular and maintainable code structure.
